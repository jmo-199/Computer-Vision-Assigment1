# Computer-Vision-Assigment1 Image Processing
This project demonstrates various image processing techniques such as min-max normalization, down-sampling, up-sampling, Gaussian smoothing, median filtering, Sobel filtering, and handling noisy images using OpenCV and NumPy in Python. The objective is to manipulate and enhance images using several filters and transformations.
# Introduction
This project applies various image processing techniques to demonstrate the following:
- Min-Max Normalization: Adjusting pixel values between 0 and 1 for uniformity.
- Down-sampling & Up-sampling: Resizing images by reducing or increasing pixel values.
- Gaussian Smoothing: Applying Gaussian filters with different kernel sizes and sigma values to smooth images.
- Median Filtering: Reducing noise by applying a median filter.
- Sobel Filtering: Edge detection using the Sobel operator.
- Noise Handling: Applying filtering techniques to images with added noise.
